My portfolio was made primarily using an Adobe XD file as a base as well as several files on Visual Studio code, specifically HTML and CSS files. When it comes to challenges and roadblocks, the biggest one was my laptop breaking and needing to get fixed. I didn't exactly overcome it, as my computer that I was stuck with was being very slow, I couldn't really work on it. Thankfully, my laptop was fixed in time for me to be able to complete the portfolio on time. Some specific sections I was having trouble with, so I decided to go back to older assignments I did and use those to draw ideas from. Creating a web portfolio was something I've never done before, so the entire thing was a learning experience, in both good and bad ways.
